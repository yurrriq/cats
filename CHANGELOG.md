# Changelog #

## Version 1.1.0 ##

Date: unreleased

- Add timeout support for manifold deferred context.


## Version 1.0.0 ##

Date: 2015-09-17

### Bug fixes

- The context doesn't need to be a monad anymore.
- Fix Foldable implementation for clojure builtin collections.

### New features

- Add additional arity to `cats.core/mempty` function, that allows provide a context
  instead of resolving it.
- Sorted map is now also implements monoid.
- Add `cats.labs` namespace for make room for previously removed **reader**, **writer**,
  **state** and **continuation** monads.
- Add core.async channel monad/applicative under `cats.labs.channel` namespace.
- Add manifold deferred monad/applicative under `cats.labs.manifold` namespace.
- Add **applicative-do** (with `alet` macro) syntax. You can read more about that in
  [haskell wiki](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/ApplicativeDo) and
  [pull request](https://github.com/funcool/cats/pull/63).
- Add **foldm** implementation to `cats.core` namespace.
- Add a bunch of monoids: `all`, `any`, `sum`, `prod`, `pair` and `string`.
- Add a [Traversable](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.1.0/docs/Data-Traversable.html)
  protocol and implementations for vector, sequence, pair, maybe, either and validation.
- Add **traverse** function to `cats.core` namespace.

### Backwards incompatible changes

- Revisit monad-transformers abstraction removing useless protocol methods: `base` and `inner`
  are no longer part of the `MonadTrans` protocol.
- The protocols methods are all renamed to `-name` for consistency with cljs style to
  name internal functions.
- The `Context` protocol has been renamed to `Contextual`, and `Context` is now a protocol
  used to mark context instances and resolve their priority.


## Version 0.6.1 ##

Date: 2015-08-02

- Remove src/user.clj that causes some problems.


## Version 0.6.0 ##

Date: 2015-08-02

- Foldable abstraction.
- Curry facilities.
- Major code cleaning.
- Context management moved into its own namespace.
- A lot of performance improvements (removing unnecessary
  function call forwarding).
- Start using the clojurescript 1.7.28.


## Version 0.5.0 ##

Date: 2015-07-13

- Set default and required clojure version to 1.7.0.
- Replace cljx with clojure 1.7 conditional reader.
- Add more util functions for treat for maybe monad types.
- Add more util functions for treat for either monad types.
- Add semigroup and monoid abstractions.
- Add validation applicative (similar to either).
- Minor performance improvements.
- Fix inconsistences between fmap / fapply public functions
  and its haskell-style aliases.
- Add more documentation.
- Deprecate the state, reader, writer and continuation
  monads. They will be moved to a separated library for
  future version.
- Remove already deprecated `from-either` function.


## Version 0.4.0 ##

Date: 2015-03-25

- The exception monad now raises a exception when you deref a failure instance.
  This will allow easy use of monadic api from libraries or applications that
  does not  use monads.
- The `cats.monad.exception/failure` function now coerce all input that not
  extends from exception to exception type (using `ex-info` clojure function).
- Add channel monad using core.async channels abstraction (as separated repository)
  This make easy treat channels as monads and using them in monadic compositions.
- Remove mlet-with macro (bacause it sintax is ugly and with-monad usage is preferable)
- Remove undocumented errlet macro.


## Version 0.3.4 ##

Date: 2015-03-14

- Improve cljx build process.


## Version 0.3.3 ##

Date: 2015-03-14

- Improvements on project.clj.


## Version 0.3.2 ##

Date: 2015-02-08

- Empty version, only exists because clojars does not
  allow remove wrong uploaded versions.


## Version 0.3.0 ##

Date: 2015-02-08

- Dependencies versions update.
- Add new arity to from-maybe function for default value.
- Update required clojurescript version to 0.0-2760.
- Use speclj for tests.
- Add IDeref implementation to either, maybe, identity and exception monads types.
- Remove maybe useless lazy monad.

## Version 0.2.0 ##

Date: 2014-10-26

- Major api redesign.
- Split monad definition from data type.
- mlet macro is now not recursive.
- New monads: lazy, exception.
- Monad transformers.
